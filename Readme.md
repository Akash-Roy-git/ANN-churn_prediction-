# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict whether a customer will **stay with or leave a company** based on a churn dataset.  
The solution follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow including **model training, prediction, and deployment** using **Streamlit** for interactive visualization.

## 🧠 Project Components

### 1️⃣ Model Training
- Built an ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained on a customer churn dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Saved the trained model for reuse

### 2️⃣ Model Prediction
- Loaded the trained ANN model
- Predicted customer churn (Stay / Leave) for new inputs
- Ensured consistent preprocessing during inference

### 3️⃣ Streamlit Deployment
- Developed an interactive Streamlit web application
- Allowed users to input customer details
- Displayed real-time churn prediction results
- Enabled easy visualization and deployment
